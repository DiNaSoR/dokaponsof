You can't surpass me at this point, [TEXT]. You should just give up.
Being unable to use items is truly more frustrating than I ever imagined.

That's a hit! Take that! Ha!
What I do isn't magic, it's Ninjutsu.
I've got some secret weapons for this!
Got a Spite 'Em here! Check this out!
Prepare to meet your maker.
What's the matter, everyone? You all chicken? Come at me!
Too late for apologies now!
So many pains in the rump! I'm getting sick of you all.
Just watch me now.
How, exactly, am I in last place?!
I'll make everyone else wish they'd never crossed me!
Being number one is boring.
Is there such a thing as too strong?
[TEXT]! I'll remember this! Don't think I won't!
My time with [TEXT] has been quite...fruitful.
Pleasure doing business with you, [TEXT]!
Guess we're working together now, [TEXT]. Put 'er there!
Heck yeah! Let's do it to it!
Guess I'll sit this one out.
Well, that helps, a bit!
Anybody wanna swap circumstances with me? I'm good for it!
Wait. Am I actually wanted?!
[TEXT]! I've got a score to settle with you!
Sealed? For real?! This just gets worse and worse!
This sure ain't looking good. Gotta hurry up and heal!
Man, when you get serious, it's no joke!
Paralysis? Really?! I can't even!
I should make better use of items.
Yes! Yesss! This is what I've been waiting for!
Just gotta crush anything in my way...
C'mon, play with me a little longer!
Having power sure is fun!
I think I'll try bullying someone...
Why am I even trying so hard? What do I stand to gain here?!
I should've left a computer AI in charge of playing for me...
Take my last place spot...please!
Is that [TEXT], or [TEXT]?
Why, pray tell, am I in third place?!
At least I wasn't beaten by [TEXT], I guess...
Hmm... Not sure how to proceed.
So, what now?
Hey, [TEXT]! Don't get cocky just 'cause you're number one!
Don't be jealous just because I'm number one.
For one such as I to lay down arms...
Hmm? Can't move?
I feel a little better now.
Things are not going well right now. I need to shake it off, and soon!
Can't use anything, huh? It's okay. This, too, shall pass!
Little help, please? Anyone?
Maaan... I hate taking things one step at a time!
Hmm. Okay. I see. Wait... Wanted? For real?! Wh-What's the meaning of this?!
This isn't exactly going to plan...
How dare you stand in my way!
Oh, you cheeky little so-and-so...
Rrrg, there's nothing worse than not being able to move!
C'mon! I'm feelin' lucky, here!
If this keeps up, I'm going to be too scared to even fight...
Being a chicken is a lot more annoying than I expected.
I should make better use of magic.
I start to fume a little when I think of anybody but me winning this thing!
This isn't even ironically funny.
[TEXT]
This is everybody's fault, and everybody's gonna pay for it!
I seem to be trailing behind.
I can still bully the person in last place, at least.
Beep, beep... Clack, clack... Destroy. All. Humans! Heheh.
Good things come to those who wait!
I'm gonna take the first place spot!
Cash
You're all just jealous!
Let's keep on keepin' on!
Cash
My power is the greatest in the world!
Curse you, [TEXT]! One of these days, pow-right in the kisser!
Well, [TEXT], I gotta say... You've been downright useless!
Hey! [TEXT]! You with me, or what?
Take my advice, [TEXT]: When in doubt, just make other people do your bidding!
My whole body is shorting out! I can't move!
What the...? My attack sensor's on the fritz!
I can't...seem to remember... Oh, well. Probably not important.
Even if I wanted to fight, I don't think I could handle this!
Something's wrong with my legs...
This ain't easy, even for me!
So, who shall I take out my anger on?
Rrrg, don't get cocky on me, now!
All according to plan!
Which magic to select...
Which item to select...
Cash
Finally! I've been waiting for this! It's Spite 'Em time! Get in!
Come on! I can take you all at once!
You'll be serving me soon enough!
You can run, but you can't hide...
If you know what's good for you, you'll get out of my way.
How in tarnation am I in last place?!
Now, what have we here?
Go too fast and you're gonna mess up.
The tiniest mistake can be fatal.
Let's keep it cool, now.
[TEXT]! Mark my words! You won't get away with this!
Come and play with me again sometime, [TEXT]!
What's yours is mine, [TEXT]!
[TEXT], please. Don't pull my leg.
Energy recharge complete! Let's get back in the game!
Surrender?! Never! I'm just using my PTO.
My body has returned to normal.
Even for me, this is tough... I need to power through it...
I think you'd best keep your distance from me. For your own sake.
Just use this magic here, and...
Whoa! My body's got a mind of its own! What's going on?!
Just use this item here, and...
I don't like not being able to use anything. This'd better wear off soon!
What's going on?! My body's not responding! Is something broken?
[TEXT]
Bingo!
If you've got a death wish, I've got you covered...
Sure would prefer not using these Spite 'Ems, if I could help it...
Nothing to fear but fear itself.
This is all in the name of victory.
Okay. Let's take that first step...
I still have a long way to go...
Never thought it'd turn out like this.
Fate can certainly be fickle!
Third place is fine. Gotta keep calm!
Relax! I just need to relax...
This is getting a bit irksome.
Best to tread carefully here.
How shall I attack next?
You ready for me? You'd better be!
No sense holding a grudge. Let's clear the air.
Yes, yes... Come on, now. Dooo eeet...
I don't even care anymore.
Sooo frustrating!
Wonder if I can come back from this...
This cannot stand!
Uhh, so... Hmm...
Why am I in third place?!
Everything's still on track.
Gangway! [TEXT], coming through!
Where should I go next?
I'll give it my all again today!
Let's keep up the pace!

I hate being in this situation...
I'm not a chicken! I'm not...
One step at a time...
How do I make the most of this...?
Okay, now, who was bullying me earlier...?
Heeey! No fair dodging!
What've you got for me, hmm?
Let's put this magic to good use and make some real progress!
Ooh, I got something real good!
Let's put this item to good use and make some real progress!
So, who's next on the chopping block?
Everything I see belongs to me!
Well, now... What to do, what to do?
I don't get it, [TEXT]. How can you try your best and still fall so hard?
Next on the agenda is...
Watch me, everybody!
Let's all give this 110 percent!
It's great to be first!
Now we're cooking!
[TEXT], you insufferable cad! Get a load of me now!
Looks like we're in this together, [TEXT]!
Hope I can count on you again if anything happens, [TEXT]!
Hehe! Look at all my earnings! Too bad, so sad, eh, [TEXT]?
Guess who's back and ready for action!
Guess I get the day off...
I'm baaa-aaack!
I can't take it anymore!
Wanted, huh? Not the smartest spot to be in...
Hmm? Something wrong?
Bullying a lady?! Harrumph!
Well, that was a bust. I don't like where this is going...
Boom. Sor-ry!
Oh, I got something really nice!
Let's use this magic...
Let's use this item...
Get in my way, and I'll put you out of it!
I've never had so much fun before!
Let's play a friendly game of Tag with [TEXT]...
I don't want to do this anymore.
Don't tempt fate, and fate won't bite.
This isn't funny at all, you know.
I don't understand why [TEXT] has to go through all this...
Such uncivilized behavior...
What do I do now? What can I do?!
Oh, [TEXT], you are just the worst!
[TEXT], I hope you'll play with me again sometime!
[TEXT], I had no choice here. Please forgive me.
It's important to know when to quit.
I've made a new friend. I look forward to working with you, [TEXT]!
[TEXT], we are so back! Let's do this!
All better now! Isn't that great?
[TEXT] is in pretty dire straits.
I promise I won't get in your way anymore. Please, forgive me!
[TEXT] is in pretty dire straits.
What have I done to deserve this, [TEXT]?! You're so cruel!
What's going on? Why is nothing working?!
I'm too scared to even move.
Ohhh! Listen to that chirping!
Ohhh! Oh, mymymy!
Ohhh! Like a little turtle!
I'm gonna have some fun with you.
Ahem. I do believe we should RUNNN!
You'll regret this.
There's only one way out of this for you...and that's if you're lucky.
I'm in...last place? Is that possible?
C'mon, everybody! Lose, already!
This. Is. So. Frustrating!
I don't want to be in third place!
Maybe I should just quit now...
How did it come to this?
There are so many things I wanna do!
No problem. Slow and steady.
So, what's next on the agenda?
Not too late to quit, you know...
Being in first place sure feels great!
I'm number one? Well, naturally.
This sucks! Why did this have to happen to me?!
Word of advice: you lay a hand on me, you're in for a world of hurt later.
Better watch yourself, [TEXT]! I may not have control, but it's still my body, so I call the shots! Capisci?
Hey, wait a sec! What's going on?! I can't use anything!
Why did this have to happen to me?!
I'd like to avoid fighting, if I can.
Umm... I can't move. What do I do?!
What do you mean, I'm a chicken?!
Why am I moving one step at a time?
Ugh! You're so annoying!
Perhaps I should dole out punishment upon those who defy me...
Come on! Make your move, already!
Did that hurt? I'm ever so sorry! Heh.
It's magic time!
This might be a good item to use.
This is it! The time is nigh! Come and see it for yourselves!
But, I have not yet begun to fight!
Third place?! How shameful...
Now is the time for stealth...
I'll admit, it's fun being a thorn in everyone else's side!
So, do I bring down the champ? Or just bully everybody else?
Enjoy first place while you still can.
You think you can beat me? You got another think coming!
Nobody's even giving me a run for my money.
What's the point of even fighting when your opponents are all amateurs?
[TEXT]! Don't you forget about me!
[TEXT]... May we meet again someday.
I have to admit, it came in handy having you around, if only a bit. Thank you, [TEXT]! ＃
Can you at least try to be of some help to me, [TEXT]? Even just a little?!
That's it. I'm on break. Fight someone else.

Nyaaa-aaaagh! *hiss* (Why would you take my money!?)
Has everyone been swindled?!
Grrr!
What? Everyone's money was stolen?!
King's been acting weird lately. Seems we finally see the big picture! And it's one ugly sight...
Hmph!
You gotta be kiddin' me! I am thoroughly riled up now!
Raaaaagh!
That's second only to my life! Return it now!
Urgh!
You...absolute...CAD!
What a fiend! I shall take the cretin's head and savings alike!
Stop! What are you doing?! What kind of king are you?! Hold on! I'm on my way!
What an awful king! Let's do some overthrowin' already!
Grrr!
You're with the Demon Lord?! How can you be so twisted?!
Whaaat?!
Myaaa! Myaoow. Myeh. (Fine! We'll do that. But don't blame me for what happens to you!)
So we shall proceed. Just know this: I show no mercy. Stand in my way, and fall in my path.
Very well. But be warned: this is my score. Stand in my way, and you're through.
Sure. That sounds good. Mostly because it means I'll be the one to get the money!
Got it! (You fools; I'll stop you all, and take the money for myself!)
Okey doke! That money's as good as mine!
Fine by me. But you'd all better stay outta my way, if you know what's good for ya.
Works for me! All right, now. Things are about to get interesting!
Myuuuueeeeh! (Let's get that money back, by hook or by crook!)
Hey.
You all too? Dearie me, that's a lot of rivals.
Everyone's in the same boat, huh? Well, that makes things easier!
So many people were tricked!
How dare he trick us! I don't care if he is a god!
Hmm?! So many victims!
Was all your money taken too? This king's a real piece o' work!
Curse you!
Argh!
Eeek! Kyaa! (Great Demon Lord, bad guy! Friends of bad guy, also bad guys!)
Weak dogs always wag their tails at stronger ones, don't they?
Hmph.
Head asplode when I try to wrap it around what he's done.
Bsssht!
What's happening to this world?! I don't even feel safe walking around!
Hrgh!
Hyahahaha!
I see why you did it, but the Demon Lord's just using you.
That's a good one. You really think this alliance means you can tell me what to do?
Oh-hohoho!
Siding with the enemy? What is the meaning of this?!
Harrumph!
No surprise, I'm the best! I'm the one destined to be king!
Oh yeeeah!
Mnnya! Mya-myaao! (Deus, you scallywag! I'm gonna claw you so hard!)
Mraaagh!
A god, of all beings, aspiring to world domination for his own selfish ends...
Mrrng...
You'll live to regret this!
Raoowr!
Can't believe it!
It's not fair, Deus! How dare you formulate such plans without informing me?!
Grrr...
The source of all evil... was that beardo Deus all along?!
The nerve! To deceive us all so thoroughly...
Hmph! Boils my blood.
Yaah, yeeeoah! (King! King, myaa!)
What a cruel god, to have deceived [TEXT] so!
Rragh!
You, the king?! I'll never accept it!
Unthinkable!
Mnyaaa!
Seizing the throne took almost no effort at all.
Hmph.
No one but I could be king. There is no better choice!
GAHAHA!
Strongest of us is gonna be king, an' that's me!
Heh! Strong, ain't I?
This is my true power. I'll rule this land with an iron fist!
Hyahahaha!
Oh-hohoho!
[TEXT] is strong! King material, for sure!
Only I could be queen!
Wooo!
Argh!
If this is how it's to be, then let's fight it out! Victory is mine!
You pullin' my leg?! I do not accept this result!
What?
Guah! Guah! (No! Can't be! Disbelieve!)
Ggaagh!
How could you become king, while I'm just brushed aside?!
This is no laughing matter! How could you be king?!
You're not fit to be king! Give up your title, this instant!
What?!
This isn't fair! You cheated!
Just hold on one minute! You think any of us will accept this?!
Rrragh...
Raoowr!
But whyyy?!
Grrr!
Defeat the king! It all comes down to this!
Urgh!
Okay, then bring it on! I'll show you my true power!
Huzzah!
Hyaa, nyukyuuu! (Time for a catfight!)
Mraaagh!
Come at me, brah! I'll show you what I'm really made of!
Thanks to the Purse String, no money was lost!
Not willing to accept me? Then let me change your mind!

Fine! Then let's settle this for keeps!

No, no thanks is necessary. Frankly, I have funds to burn! I shall be off, now. Ta!
Received ,[NUM]G.
Hello there, commoner!
How are you faring this fine day? I am the resident millionaire, Dadah.
So considerate of you to include them.
So considerate of you to include them.
Oho? You say the others wish to grant a bestowment as well?
[TEXT], you say? That is the bestowment you seek?
I shall reward your efforts with something worthy.
How lovely for you, [TEXT]!
Hrmm?
What, I say, what do you seek?
Divinely well done, [TEXT]!
Just a moment, I say, hold the phone!
[TEXT] seems to be offering up ,[NUM]G.
I do decree, that was nicely done! Not that I'd expect anything less.
Goodness me, my necklace! Thanks ever so!
Oho, I say, oho! So [TEXT] is the first to arrive?
Welcome, I say, welcome, one and all!
[TEXT] seems to be offering up some [TEXT].
Then let us gather at the castle, and
Mm. A fine stopping point, I do decree! But shall you, I say, shall you continue to play?
Hmm? I do decree, [TEXT] doesn't seem to have any equipment!
Hmm? I do decree, there's no land left to develop.
Hmm? I do decree, not a soul has anything valuable to speak of!
Hmm? I do decree, there's no land to develop here.
Hmm? I do decree, no one has any money at all!
Hmm? I do decree, [TEXT] has no money to their name at all! Not even a gold tooth.
Here. I do decree, this is for you.
Hmm? I do decree, [TEXT] doesn't have a lick of treasure! Not a lick, I say!
Quite generous, wouldn't you say? Perhaps friends are the real treasure!
I do declare, [TEXT] seems to be offering up [TEXT] [TEXT]!
Hmm? I say, [TEXT] doesn't seem to have any funds at all.
Hmm... Would [TEXT] [TEXT] suffice?
Hmm... Would you take ,[NUM]G?
That's quite a shame, I do decree! I have no savings of my own, either.
I do decree, it was a valiant effort! It just wasn't quite valiant enough.
Hmm... [TEXT] sound good to you?
So considerate of you to include them.
How does ,[NUM]G sound?
Hiii! Goddess Cash, at your service! ＃
You know what they say: if you want something done right, do it yourself!
Would [TEXT] [TEXT] suffice?
[TEXT] sound good to you?
I'll sign over [TEXT]'s [TEXT] [TEXT] to you, then, okay?
I'll give you [TEXT]'s ,[NUM]G, then, okay?
I'll give you [TEXT]'s [TEXT], then, okay?
My, how extravagant!
Work hard, and pay me all the taxes!
Give it everything you've got!
All the treasure's been divvied up.
Deus is busy today, so I'm here to fill in! ＃
Hmm? I do decree, no one has any savings at all!
Still waffling...
Hmm? I do decree, [TEXT] has nothing saved up at all!
Hmm? I do decree, [TEXT] has no land of their own.
Loyal subjects! I do decree, the road to the next continent is now open! Go! Foil Wallace's machinations!
This is for [TEXT]...
I say, here we go...
Hmm? Well, I do decree, it seems another two have allied!
Wh-What, I say, what did you say?!
Oh, before that...
[TEXT]
[TEXT]
Go seek your own bounty.
Ugh, I've had enough!
Capricious, aren't we?
Total: ,[NUM]G.
Hiii! Goddess Cash, at your service! ＃
Gosh, no one has anything?!
You can't go relying on other people, you dig? Till next time, then... ＃
I'm certain, I say, certain that fiend, Wallace, is scheming again!
That would be...
My loyal subjects, I do decree: the road to the next continent is open, so go give Wallace a royal whupping!
But at long last, it's new king time!
For the Castle in the Clouds to appear on the surface, I say, Wallace must be defeated and his barrier broken!
I do decree, that dastardly fellow is as...as dastardly as ever!
I-Impossible! Wallace is still alive?!
I-I say! Wallace, haven't you learned your lesson yet?
Y-Yeeeeek! I-Isn't that...?!
I do decree, it's been so long...
I-Impossible! Wallace is still alive?!
Would you like to save, I say, save your adventure up till now?
That fiend Wallace brought monsters from the Underworld to the surface!
Huh? You too?! Wahaha...
So, Wallace speaks the same drivel as ever, does he?
Hmm? You want something in return? Ahh, fine, fine! It's on me!
One last push to peace, I do decree!
Ohh, baby! It's tax time again, and my body and soul are ready!
His Majesty collected ,%{Money}dG from %{Name}s.
What in the overworld?! What, I say, what's going on here?!
Right. Best of luck! ＃
Hmm? Don't tell me Wallace has actually given up the ghost!
What?! Is this the fiend's objective?! I do decree!
Did somebody kill the spotlight? Who turned out the lights?!
Oho? Where, I say, where did that no-good Wallace run off to now?
Now, then, I do decree, it's come to be anyone's game now...
Which is why I'll be praying that much harder for you!
I do decree, well done, everyone!
Would you like to hear that again?
Hmm? What about me, you ask?
Do you need me to re-decree that?
At this rate, I say, at this rate, you'll need to catch him off-guard and seal that door shut once more!
Hell's Door! Gate to the Underworld!
...Hmm?!
How dreadful, I say, dreadful!
Now! To the cave, I say, the cave! May it be Wallace's last stand!
I've got a bad feeling about this...
Wallace's finally turned tail and ran! He's holed up in Dead End Cave!
Terrible tidings, everyone!
This is your destination.
This, I say, this is your destination.
Hiii! Me again. I know, big bummer!
Make for Heaven, and any wickedness in one's heart should heal right up.
B-B-B-Big trouble, I do decree!
Oho? Where, I say, where did that no-good Wallace run off to now?
Gosh, is Wallace just sitting this one out or something?
A reward?
Anyways! I've got a task for all y'all, to help pass the time.
Best of luck, and me-speed!
Deus is on break, so I'm filling in. But it's so boooring around here!
Don't tease me, I say, don't tease me about my fear of the dark...
Now, make haste to my location!
What a successful venture!
Thanks in advance! Me-speed!
I do decree, I was hoping you might humor a little request of mine.
This, I say, this is your destination.
I do decree, that cretinous Wallace is at it, I say, at it again!
The consequences could be disastrous. You must stop him, I do decree!
I do decree, that infernal Wallace! He's made a break for the Pyramid. Gonna try to curse us good, I bet!
The culprit is a monster called Friday that dwells, I say, dwells in the Lost Woods.
While we were all focused on Wallace, there was a bank heist, I do decree!
