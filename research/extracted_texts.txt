\pAll right, 'fess up.\nWho's the wise guy?!
\pThat's a hit!\nTake that! Ha!
\pWhat I do isn't magic, it's Ninjutsu.
\pI've got some secret weapons for this!
\pGot a %3cSpite 'Em%0c here!\nCheck this out!
\pPrepare to meet your maker.
\pWhat's the matter, everyone?\nYou all chicken? Come at me!
\pToo late for apologies now!
\pSo many pains in the rump!\nI'm getting sick of you all.
\pJust watch me now.
\pHow, exactly, am I in last place?!
\pI'll make everyone else\nwish they'd never crossed me!
\pBeing number one is boring.
\pIs there such a thing as too strong?
\p%1c%s%0c! I'll remember this!\nDon't think I won't!
\pMy time with %3c%s%0c\nhas been quite...fruitful.
\pPleasure doing business with you,\n%3c%s%0c!
\pGuess we're working together now,\n%3c%s%0c. Put 'er there!
\pHeck yeah!\nLet's do it to it!
\pGuess I'll sit this one out.
\pWell, that helps, a bit!
\pAnybody wanna swap circumstances\nwith me? I'm good for it!
\pWait. Am I actually %1cwanted%0c?!
\p%1c%s%0c!\nI've got a score to settle with you!
\pSealed? For real?!\nThis just gets worse and worse!
\pThis sure ain't looking good.\nGotta hurry up and heal!
\pMan, when you get serious,\nit's no joke!
\pParalysis? Really?!\nI can't even!
\pI should make better use of items.
\pYes! Yesss!\nThis is what I've been waiting for!
\pJust gotta crush anything in my way...
\pC'mon, play with me a little longer!
\pHaving power sure is fun!
\pI think I'll try bullying someone...
\pWhy am I even trying so hard?\nWhat do I stand to gain here?!
\pI should've left a computer AI\nin charge of playing for me...
\pTake my last place spot...please!
\pIs that %1c%s%0c,\nor %1c%s%0c?
\pWhy, pray tell, am I in third place?!
\pAt least I wasn't beaten by\n%3c%s%0c, I guess...
\pHmm...\nNot sure how to proceed.
\pSo, what now?
\pHey, %1c%s%0c! Don't get cocky\njust 'cause you're number one!
\pDon't be jealous\njust because I'm number one.
\pFor one such as I to lay down arms...
\pHmm?\nCan't move?
\pI feel a little better now.
\pThings are not going well right now.\nI need to shake it off, and soon!
\pCan't use anything, huh? It's okay.\nThis, too, shall pass!
\pLittle help, please? Anyone?
\pMaaan... I hate taking things\none step at a time!
\pHmm. Okay. I see. Wait...\n%1cWanted%0c? For real?!\nWh-What's the meaning of this?!
\pThis isn't exactly going to plan...
\pHow dare you stand in my way!
\pOh, you cheeky little so-and-so...
\pRrrg, there's nothing worse\nthan not being able to move!
\pC'mon! I'm feelin' lucky, here!
\pIf this keeps up, I'm going to\nbe too scared to even fight...
\pBeing a chicken is a lot\nmore annoying than I expected.
\pI should make better use of magic.
\pI start to fume a little when I think\nof anybody but me winning this thing!
\pThis isn't even ironically funny.
\p%s
\pThis is everybody's fault, and\neverybody's gonna pay for it!
\pI seem to be trailing behind.
\pI can still bully the person\nin last place, at least.
\pBeep, beep...\nClack, clack...\nDestroy. All. Humans! Heheh.
\pGood things come to those who wait!
\pI'm gonna take the first place spot!
\pCash
\pYou're all just jealous!
\pLet's keep on keepin' on!
\pCash
\pMy power is the greatest in the world!
\pCurse you, %1c%s%0c! One of these\ndays, pow-right in the kisser!
\pWell, %3c%s%0c, I gotta say...\nYou've been downright useless!
\pHey! %3c%s%0c!\nYou with me, or what?
\pTake my advice, %3c%s%0c:\nWhen in doubt, just make other\npeople do your bidding!
\pMy whole body is shorting out!\nI can't move!
\pWhat the...? My attack sensor's\non the fritz!
\pI can't...seem to remember...\nOh, well. Probably not important.
\pEven if I wanted to fight,\nI don't think I could handle this!
\pSomething's wrong with my legs...
\pThis ain't easy, even for me!
\pSo, who shall I take out my anger on?
\pRrrg, don't get cocky on me, now!
\pAll according to plan!
\pWhich magic to select...
\pWhich item to select...
\pCash
\pFinally! I've been waiting for this!\nIt's %3cSpite 'Em%0c time! Get in!
\pCome on! I can take you all at once!
\pYou'll be serving me soon enough!
\pYou can run, but you can't hide...
\pIf you know what's good for you,\nyou'll get out of my way.
\pHow in tarnation am I in last place?!
\pNow, what have we here?
\pGo too fast and you're gonna mess up.
\pThe tiniest mistake can be fatal.
\pLet's keep it cool, now.
\p%1c%s%0c! Mark my words!\nYou won't get away with this!
\pCome and play with me again\nsometime, %3c%s%0c!
\pWhat's yours is mine, %3c%s%0c!
\p%3c%s%0c, please.\nDon't pull my leg.
\pEnergy recharge complete!\nLet's get back in the game!
\pSurrender?! Never!\nI'm just using my PTO.
\pMy body has returned to normal.
\pEven for me, this is tough...\nI need to power through it...
\pI think you'd best keep your distance\nfrom me. For your own sake.
\pJust use this magic here, and...
\pWhoa! My body's got a mind of its own!\nWhat's going on?!
\pJust use this item here, and...
\pI don't like not being able to use\nanything. This'd better wear off soon!
\pWhat's going on?! My body's not\nresponding! Is something broken?
\p%s\n
\pBingo!
\pIf you've got a death wish,\nI've got you covered...
\pSure would prefer not using these\n%3cSpite 'Ems%0c, if I could help it...
\pNothing to fear but fear itself.
\pThis is all in the name of victory.
\pOkay. Let's take that first step...
\pI still have a long way to go...
\pNever thought it'd turn out like this.
\pFate can certainly be fickle!
\pThird place is fine. Gotta keep calm!
\pRelax! I just need to relax...
\pThis is getting a bit irksome.
\pBest to tread carefully here.
\pHow shall I attack next?
\pYou ready for me? You'd better be!
\pNo sense holding a grudge.\nLet's clear the air.
\pYes, yes...\nCome on, now. Dooo eeet...
\pI don't even care anymore.
\pSooo frustrating!
\pWonder if I can come back from this...
\pThis cannot stand!
\pUhh, so... Hmm...
\pWhy am I in third place?!
\pEverything's still on track.
\pGangway! %3c%s%0c, coming through!
\pWhere should I go next?
\pI'll give it my all again today!
\pLet's keep up the pace!
\pBarrin
\pLattin
\p%1c%s%0c! Don't you dare do\nanything weird with my body!
\pAll
\pFear
\pI have no idea what to do...
\pSeriously, this situation is\nno joke. I'm in trouble here!
\pI don't want to fight!\nI need to patch things up, and fast...
\pI hate being in this situation...
\pI'm not a chicken! I'm not...
\pOne step at a time...
\pHow do I make the most of this...?
\pOkay, now, who was bullying\nme earlier...?
\pHeeey! No fair dodging!
\pWhat've you got for me, hmm?
\pLet's put this magic to good use\nand make some real progress!
\pOoh, I got something real good!
\pLet's put this item to good use\nand make some real progress!
\pSo, who's next on the chopping block?
\pEverything I see belongs to me!
\pWell, now... What to do, what to do?
\pI don't get it, %3c%s%0c.\nHow can you try your best\nand still fall so hard?
\pNext on the agenda is...
\pWatch me, everybody!
\pLet's all give this 110 percent!
\pIt's great to be first!
\pNow we're cooking!
\p%1c%s%0c, you insufferable cad!\nGet a load of me now!
\pLooks like we're in this together,\n%3c%s%0c!
\pHope I can count on you again\nif anything happens, %3c%s%0c!
\pHehe! Look at all my earnings!\nToo bad, so sad, eh, %3c%s%0c?
\pGuess who's back and\nready for action!
\pGuess I get the day off...
\pI'm baaa-aaack!
\pI can't take it anymore!
\p%1cWanted%0c, huh?\nNot the smartest spot to be in...
\pHmm?\nSomething wrong?
\pBullying a lady?! Harrumph!
\pWell, that was a bust.\nI don't like where this is going...
\pBoom. Sor-ry!
\pOh, I got something really nice!
\pLet's use this magic...
\pLet's use this item...
\pGet in my way,\nand I'll put you out of it!
\pI've never had so much fun before!
\pLet's play a friendly game\nof Tag with %3c%s%0c...
\pI don't want to do this anymore.
\pDon't tempt fate, and fate won't bite.
\pThis isn't funny at all, you know.
\pI don't understand why %3c%s%0c\nhas to go through all this...
\pSuch uncivilized behavior...
\pWhat do I do now? What can I do?!
\pOh, %1c%s%0c, you are just\nthe worst!
\p%3c%s%0c, I hope you'll play\nwith me again sometime!
\p%3c%s%0c, I had no choice here.\nPlease forgive me.
\pIt's important to know when to quit.
\pI've made a new friend. I look forward\nto working with you, %3c%s%0c!
\p%3c%s%0c, we are so back!\nLet's do this!
\pAll better now!\nIsn't that great?
\p%3c%s%0c is in pretty dire straits.
\pI promise I won't get in your way\nanymore. Please, forgive me!
\p%3c%s%0c is in pretty dire straits.
\pWhat have I done to deserve this,\n%3c%s%0c?! You're so cruel!
\pWhat's going on?\nWhy is nothing working?!
\pI'm too scared to even move.
\pOhhh!\nListen to that chirping!
\pOhhh!\nOh, mymymy!
\pOhhh!\nLike a little turtle!
\pI'm gonna have some fun with you.
\pAhem. I do believe we should RUNNN!
\pYou'll regret this.
\pThere's only one way out of this\nfor you...and that's if you're lucky.
\pI'm in...last place? Is that possible?
\pC'mon, everybody! Lose, already!
\pThis. Is. So. Frustrating!
\pI don't want to be in third place!
\pMaybe I should just quit now...
\pHow did it come to this?
\pThere are so many things I wanna do!
\pNo problem. Slow and steady.
\pSo, what's next on the agenda?
\pNot too late to quit, you know...
\pBeing in first place sure feels great!
\pI'm number one? Well, naturally.
\pThis sucks!\nWhy did this have to happen to me?!
\pWord of advice: you lay a hand on me,\nyou're in for a world of hurt later.
\pBetter watch yourself, %1c%s%0c!\nI may not have control, but it's still\nmy body, so I call the shots! Capisci?
\pHey, wait a sec! What's going on?!\nI can't use anything!
\pWhy did this have to\nhappen to me?!
\pI'd like to avoid fighting, if I can.
\pUmm... I can't move.\nWhat do I do?!
\pWhat do you mean, I'm a chicken?!
\pWhy am I moving one step at a time?
\pUgh! You're so annoying!
\pPerhaps I should dole out\npunishment upon those who defy me...
\pCome on! Make your move, already!
\pDid that hurt?\nI'm ever so sorry! Heh.
\pIt's magic time!
\pThis might be a good item to use.
\pThis is it! The time is nigh!\nCome and see it for yourselves!
\pBut, I have not yet begun to fight!
\pThird place?! How shameful...
\pNow is the time for stealth...
\pI'll admit, it's fun being a thorn\nin everyone else's side!
\pSo, do I bring down the champ?\nOr just bully everybody else?
\pEnjoy first place while you still can.
\pYou think you can beat me?\nYou got another think coming!
\pNobody's even giving me\na run for my money.
\pWhat's the point of even fighting\nwhen your opponents are all amateurs?
\p%1c%s%0c!\nDon't you forget about me!
\p%3c%s%0c...\nMay we meet again someday.
\pI have to admit, it came in handy\nhaving you around, if only a bit.\nThank you, %3c%s%0c! %1c＃%0c
\pCan you at least try to be of some\nhelp to me, %3c%s%0c?\nEven just a little?!
\pThat's it. I'm on break.\nFight someone else.

\pSo considerate of you to include them.\k
\pSo considerate of you to include them.\k
\pOho? You say the others wish to\ngrant a bestowment as well?\k
\p%3c%s%0c, you say?\nThat is the bestowment you seek?\k
\pI shall reward your efforts with\nsomething worthy.
\pHow lovely for you, %3c%s%0c!
\pHrmm?\n
\pWhat, I say, what do you seek?
\pDivinely well done, %3c%s%0c!\n
\pJust a moment, I say, hold the phone!\k
\p%3c%s%0c seems to be offering\nup \h%2c\,%d%0cG.\k
\pI do decree, that was nicely done!\nNot that I'd expect anything less.\k
\pGoodness me, my necklace!\nThanks ever so!\k
\pOho, I say, oho! So %3c%s%0c\nis the first to arrive?\k
\pWelcome, I say, welcome, one and all!\k
\p%3c%s%0c seems to be offering\nup some %2c%s%0c.\k
\pThen let us gather at the castle, and\k
\pMm. A fine stopping point, I do\ndecree! But shall you, I say,\nshall you continue to play?
\pHmm? I do decree, %3c%s%0c\ndoesn't seem to have any equipment!\k
\pHmm? I do decree,\nthere's no land left to develop.\k
\pHmm? I do decree, not a soul\nhas anything valuable to speak of!\k
\pHmm? I do decree,\nthere's no land to develop here.\k
\pHmm? I do decree,\nno one has any money at all!\k
\pHmm? I do decree, %3c%s%0c\nhas no money to their name at all!\nNot even a gold tooth.\k
\pHere. I do decree, this is for you.\k
\pHmm? I do decree, %3c%s%0c\ndoesn't have a lick of treasure!\nNot a lick, I say!\k
\pQuite generous, wouldn't you say?\nPerhaps friends are the real treasure!\k
\pI do declare, %3c%s%0c seems to be\noffering up %2c%s %s%0c!\k
\pHmm? I say, %3c%s%0c doesn't seem\nto have any funds at all.\k
\pHmm...\nWould %2c%s %s%0c suffice?
\pHmm...\nWould you take \h%2c\,%d%0cG?
\pThat's quite a shame, I do decree!\nI have no savings of my own, either.\k
\pI do decree, it was a valiant effort!\nIt just wasn't quite valiant enough.\k
\pHmm...\n%2c%s%0c sound good to you?
\pSo considerate of you to include them.\k
\pHow does \h%2c\,%d%0cG sound?
\pHiii! Goddess Cash, at your service! %1c＃%0c
\pYou know what they say: if you want\nsomething done right, do it yourself!
\pWould %2c%s %s%0c suffice?
\p%2c%s%0c sound good to you?
\pI'll sign over %3c%s%0c's\n%2c%s %s to you, then, okay?\k
\pI'll give you %2c%s%0c's\n\h%2c\,%d%0cG, then, okay?\k
\pI'll give you %3c%s%0c's\n%2c%s%0c, then, okay?\k
\pMy, how extravagant!\n
\pWork hard, and pay me all the taxes!
\pGive it everything you've got!
\pAll the treasure's been divvied up.\k
\pDeus is busy today,\nso I'm here to fill in! %1c＃%0c\k
\pHmm? I do decree, no one\nhas any savings at all!\k
\pStill waffling...\n
\pHmm? I do decree, %3c%s%0c\nhas nothing saved up at all!\k
\pHmm? I do decree, %3c%s%0c\nhas no land of their own.\k
\pLoyal subjects! I do decree, the road\nto the next continent is now open!\nGo! Foil Wallace's machinations!
\pThis is for %3c%s%0c...\k
\pI say, here we go...\k
\pHmm? Well, I do decree,\nit seems another two have allied!\k
\pWh-What, I say, what did you say?!
\pOh, before that...\k
\p\h%2x%s\n
\p\h\r%2x%s
\pGo seek your own bounty.\k
\pUgh, I've had enough!\n
\pCapricious, aren't we?\k
\pTotal: \h%3c\,%d%0cG.
\pHiii! Goddess Cash, at your service! %1c＃%0c
\pGosh, no one has anything?!\k
\pYou can't go relying on other people,\nyou dig? Till next time, then... %1c＃%0c
\pI'm certain, I say, certain that\nfiend, Wallace, is scheming again!
\pThat would be...
\pMy loyal subjects, I do decree: the\nroad to the next continent is open,\nso go give Wallace a royal whupping!
\pBut at long last, it's new king time!
\pFor the Castle in the Clouds to appear\non the surface, I say, Wallace must\nbe defeated and his barrier broken!
\pI do decree, that dastardly fellow\nis as...as dastardly as ever!
\pI-Impossible!\nWallace is still alive?!
\pI-I say! Wallace, haven't you\nlearned your lesson yet?
\pY-Yeeeeek! I-Isn't that...?!\n
\pI do decree, it's been so long...\k
\pI-Impossible!\nWallace is still alive?!
\pWould you like to save, I say,\nsave your adventure up till now?
\pThat fiend Wallace brought monsters\nfrom the Underworld to the surface!\k
\pHuh? You too?!\nWahaha...
\pSo, Wallace speaks the same\ndrivel as ever, does he?
\pHmm? You want something in return?\nAhh, fine, fine!\nIt's on me!
\pOne last push to peace, I do decree!
\pOhh, baby! It's tax time again,\nand my body and soul are ready!
\pHis Majesty collected %3c\,%{Money}d%0cG\n\hfrom %3c%{Name}s%0c.
\pWhat in the overworld?!\nWhat, I say, what's going on here?!
\pRight. Best of luck! %1c＃%0c
\pHmm? Don't tell me Wallace has\nactually given up the ghost!
\pWhat?! Is this the fiend's\nobjective?! I do decree!
\pDid somebody kill the spotlight?\nWho turned out the lights?!
\pOho? Where, I say, where did that\nno-good Wallace run off to now?
\pNow, then, I do decree, it's come\nto be anyone's game now...
\pWhich is why I'll be praying\nthat much harder for you!\k
\pI do decree, well done, everyone!
\pWould you like to hear that again?
\pHmm? What about me, you ask?\k
\pDo you need me to re-decree that?
\pAt this rate, I say, at this rate,\nyou'll need to catch him off-guard\nand seal that door shut once more!
\p%1cHell's Door%0c! Gate to the Underworld!\k
\p...Hmm?!
\pHow dreadful, I say, dreadful!\k
\pNow! To the cave, I say, the cave!\nMay it be Wallace's last stand!
\pI've got a bad feeling about this...
\pWallace's finally turned tail and ran!\nHe's holed up in Dead End Cave!
\pTerrible tidings, everyone!
\pThis is your destination.\k
\pThis, I say, this is your destination.\k
\pHiii! Me again. I know, big bummer!
\pMake for Heaven, and any wickedness\nin one's heart should heal right up.\k
\pB-B-B-Big trouble, I do decree!\k
\pOho? Where, I say, where did that\nno-good Wallace run off to now?
\pGosh, is Wallace just sitting\nthis one out or something?
\pA reward?
\pAnyways! I've got a task for\nall y'all, to help pass the time.\k
\pBest of luck, and me-speed!
\pDeus is on break, so I'm filling in.\nBut it's so boooring around here!
\pDon't tease me, I say, don't tease\nme about my fear of the dark...\k
\pNow, make haste to my location!\k
\pWhat a successful venture!
\pThanks in advance! Me-speed!
\pI do decree, I was hoping you might\nhumor a little request of mine.\k
\pThis, I say, this is your destination.\k
\pI do decree, that cretinous Wallace\nis at it, I say, at it again!\k
\pThe consequences could be disastrous.\nYou must stop him, I do decree!\k
\pI do decree, that infernal Wallace!\nHe's made a break for the Pyramid.\nGonna try to curse us good, I bet!
\pThe culprit is a monster called\n%1cFriday%0c that dwells, I say, dwells\nin the Lost Woods.\k
\pWhile we were all focused on Wallace,\nthere was a bank heist, I do decree!
