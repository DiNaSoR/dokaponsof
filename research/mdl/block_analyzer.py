Block Analyzer
A specialized tool for analyzing compression block boundaries and alignment markers in binary data.

Created by: DiNaSoR
Repository: https://github.com/DiNaSoR/dokaponsof
License: GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)

Features:
- Intelligent block boundary detection
- Alignment marker identification (0xAA, 0xFF, 0x00)
- Configurable block size analysis
- Support for multiple data formats
- Detailed block statistics and reporting

Usage: 
    from block_analyzer import analyze_blocks
    
    # Analyze file contents
    with open('input.bin', 'rb') as f:
        data = f.read()
        blocks = analyze_blocks(data)
    
    # Process block information
    for block in blocks:
        print(f"Block at {block['start']}, size: {block['size']}")
        for marker_pos, marker_value in block['markers']:
            print(f"  Marker at {marker_pos}: 0x{marker_value:02X}")

Parameters:
    data (bytes): Binary data to analyze
    block_size (int): Size of blocks to analyze (default: 32768)

Returns:
    list: List of dictionaries containing block information:
        - 'start': Starting position of block
        - 'size': Size of block in bytes
        - 'markers': List of tuples (position, value) for alignment markers

Block Marker Support:
- 0xAA: Standard alignment marker
- 0xFF: Fill pattern marker
- 0x00: Zero-fill marker

Note: This tool is designed to work in conjunction with the LZ77 decompressor
for optimal block boundary detection and compression analysis.
