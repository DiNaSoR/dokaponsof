**[Buy]** Magic has a wide range of effects. Select the right one for you and press the B button to finalize the purchase!

### Types of magic

#### Field Magic
Magic that can be used on the overworld/board (rather than during battle). Characters can have between 8 and 12 varieties of magic at the ready at any given time.

#### Offensive Magic
Press the Y button in battle when you're the Attacker to use Offensive Magic. Characters can carry up to 99 of any one variety of spell at a time.

#### Defensive Magic
Press the Y button in battle when you're the Defender to use Defensive Magic. Each variety of Defensive Magic can be used repeatedly.

### Magic hit rate
Select a magic spell and then a target. You can quickly snap the cursor between your character and Wallace (the bad guy) with the left bumper and right bumper. Move the cursor over your target and press the B button to get a sneak peek into the accuracy and expected damage of your attack. If multiple characters and/or monsters occupy the same space, they'll each be listed in turn.

### Combined Magic
When allied with another character, both you and your ally will fire off your spells in tandem, seamlessly combining your forces. Combined Offensive Magic strikes make for ultra-powerful tandem attacks! For example, if you cast "Meteor" in battle, your ally will do the same, and the result will be the far more powerful "Mega Meteor" spell!

{: .note }
> Some characters like Molde can use magic twice in a row and build magic in battle for enhanced power.
