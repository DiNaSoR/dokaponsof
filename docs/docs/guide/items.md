### Weapon Shop

| Command | Function |
|:--------|:---------|
| **[Buy]** | You can purchase not just weapons here, but armor (including both body armor and shields) as well. This equipment will have a profound impact on your stats, so pick and choose the right gear for you and press the B button to finalize the purchase. Previous equipment will be traded in automatically. |
| **[Sell]** | Sell items, spells, or equipment (weapons and armor alike) from your inventory, as applicable. |
| **[Attack]** | Succeed, and you'll get your selection for free. (Fail, however, and you'll be wanted for your crimes!) |
| **[Quit]** | End your turn. |

{: .note }
> Note that along with Buy, the Sell, Attack, and Quit commands listed above apply not just to Weapon Shops, but Magic and Item Shops as well.

### Item Shop

**[Buy]** Items have a wide range of effects. Select the right one for you and press the B button to finalize the purchase! Characters can carry between 8 and 12 items at one time.

**[Apprs.]** (Appraise) Determine the value and effect of a treasure. Each item appraised costs 100G.

### Inn

**[Stay]** Fully restore your HP for 200G. Inns are open every day of the week, including Saturdays and Sundays.

{: .warning }
> Steel yourself when stealing!  
> If all goes well, you can get huge sums of money or rare items by using the "Attack" command at villages, towns, cities, shops, and banks. However, if your heist should fail, you'll become a wanted criminal (see p.17)! And wanted criminals can't restore HP at inns, nor can they visit villages, towns, or cities. But the thrill of being a fugitive is all part of the fun, right? Right?!
