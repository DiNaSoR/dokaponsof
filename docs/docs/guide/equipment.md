BASICS
{: .label .label-blue }

### General Rules
- Shields and armor increase your DF stat when equipped
- Some equipment has special effects that trigger at the start of battle
- Cursed equipment cannot be unequipped without paying to remove the curse at a church
- Monsters can drop equipment that's typically stronger than what's available in shops on that continent
- Equipment can be destroyed by certain monster skills, attack magic, or losing battles
- Some field magic like "Barabaranba" can also cause you to lose equipment

### Additional Mechanics
- Unlike other Dokapon games, you can use defensive magic without equipping a shield
- Special effects usually trigger at the start of battle with a certain probability
- Equipment can be obtained from:
  - Shops in towns
  - Monster drops (usually stronger than shop equipment)
  - Special events and locations
  - Question mark spaces (some equipment is exclusive to these)
- Cursed equipment requires payment at a church to remove

### Equipment Progression
- Each continent's shops sell progressively stronger equipment
- Monster drops are typically one tier higher than local shop equipment
- Special equipment from events/spaces often has unique effects
- Cursed equipment generally has powerful effects to offset the curse
