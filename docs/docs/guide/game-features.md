# This is DOKAPON!
{: .no_toc }

A comprehensive overview of DOKAPON! Sword of Fury's key features and gameplay mechanics.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

1. TOC

## 1. Ruining friendships, up to four players at a time!
{: .d-inline-block }

MULTIPLAYER
{: .label .label-purple }

While taking on the game's diverse cast of characters by your lonesome is fun enough, it's nothing compared to duking it out with your friends in a four-player free-for-all! Only got one controller? No problem. Friends not around? Play with 'em online! (They can't escape that easily!)

{: .note }
> "You are free to play as you'd like, so you can always work together with friends, too!"

Point is, pulse-pounding player-vs-player battles where you snatch away the prized possessions of others and become filthy rich off their hard work is the name of the game here in the "anything goes" world of DOKAPON! Might as well start looking for new friends now...

## 2. A "board game RPG" where your fate is in the spinner's hand!
{: .d-inline-block }

GAMEPLAY
{: .label .label-green }

The rules are simple! Take turns flicking the spinner to see how far you can go, like rolling dice in a board game. Level up your character along the way by traversing the massive boards and winning battles! With enough experience points, defeating monsters will be a breeze.

{: .highlight }
> "Vanquish your foes and level, level, level!"

And before you know it, no one else will be able to stand in your way! If you want to maintain the lead, though, don't forget about buying the latest and greatest equipment. And magic, and items, too! All that good RPG stuff!

## 3. Money is power!
{: .d-inline-block }

ECONOMY
{: .label .label-yellow }


Money is the bottom line, period! You can put all your stats in strength and become a total beefcake, but it won't do you any good if you're broke! Total net worth determines the winner in the end, and everyone who's not a winner is a loooser!

Your net worth consists of:
- Funds (On-hand money)
- Savings (Bank deposits)
- Treasure (Valuable items)

{: .important }
> "Money makes the world go 'round!"

So make sure you're constantly building up villages and slaying monsters to keep that sweet dosh funneling in!

{: .warning }
> Highest Net Worth WINS!

## Before Setting Off!

CONTROLS
{: .label .label-blue }

### Switching between player and CPU

You can swap character control from a human player to computer AI at any time during gameplay via the Settings → Switch command (see p.15). You can then press the Menu Button during that character's turn to revert them back to being human-controlled.


### Switching controllers

Players can select which controller to use if multiples are available and the game is being played with two or more participants. Just select the total number of players, then each player can pick their controller of choice. If you wish to make this change during play, you can do so via the Settings → Controller command (see p.15).

SETUP
{: .label .label-green }

### Getting this show on the road

Press the B button to skip the opening if you so desire, then use the D-pad on the main menu to make your selection, and the B button to confirm.

You can also press the Menu button to view the credits if you so desire, or the Y button to fiddle with the game's settings.

### The Chronicles!

{: .highlight }
> Select this to view rankings from past games.

#### Rankings?
"The Chronicles!" keeps track of data for up to eight players. It's automatically updated with juicy data points per map as players clear that map. Note that a player changing their name will not affect their past data, but actually deleting that player will scrub all data associated with them.

#### Online Data
You can switch between offline and online play data with the X button on personal and small-to-large map data sets.

### The Game!

{: .highlight }
> Pick your mode and your number of players, then start the game!

1. **Play mode**  
   Select the option to play online if you wish to face off over the internet with players across the globe (see Online Mode on p.31).

2. **Difficulty level**  
   On higher difficulties, characters will start with lower stats.

3. **Number of players and turn order**  
   Select how many human players there will be, as well as how many AI-controlled CPU players. You can then choose to load player data, or enter a new name to register a new character. Once all the controller settings are taken care of, the order of play will be determined by roulette.

4. **Character selection**  
   You can cycle through character profiles by pressing up and down on the D-pad. Choose a character with left and right on the D-pad, and press the B button to confirm.

5. **Allotting points**  
   Character stats are initialized from points allotted by the player. Select the stat you wish to strengthen (see p.13) and press the B button to pump it up. The game will start once all characters are fully set up.

## What Are You Looking At?!
{: .d-inline-block }

UI GUIDE
{: .label .label-blue }

### What's in a UI?

1. **Commands**  
   Use these to control your character.

2. **Character**  
   The character you control. Any extra icons displayed indicate status ailments.  
   Also, a mini devil may appear above the head of whosoever is in last place.

3. **Stats (P.13)**  
   An overview of the character's strength values and general condition.

4. **Day, week, season (See the illustration on the left)**  
   The current season and day, and how many (in-game) weeks have passed since the start of the game.

5. **Spaces (P.18)**  
   Points on the map that a character can occupy or move through.

### Days, weeks, and seasons

One (in-game) day passes when all players have ended their turn. On (again, in-game) Saturdays, stores have a 25% discount, but banks are closed. And on (yep, you guessed it, in-game) Sundays, all stores and banks are just plain closed. Too bad, so sad! Events may trigger, too, based on the (do I even need to specify I mean in-game?) season.

### "Avaris Personae"
{: .d-inline-block }

## What Commands Can Do For You!
{: .d-inline-block }

GAMEPLAY CONTROLS
{: .label .label-green }

### Move → Where will the spinner take you?

Movement is based on where the spinner arm lands, and you can stop it a bit prematurely by pressing the A button. Once you've got the number of spaces to move squared away, use the D-pad or select "Auto" (see below) to choose your direction. While moving, you can examine spaces with the B button, confirm data with the X button, or display the map with the Menu button.

{: .note }
> A handy shortcut (Auto)  
> Press the Y button after the spinner stops and a "↓" symbol will display over all the spaces you can reach. Move the cursor to the desired space and press the B button, and your character will begin heading there automatically.

### Use → Use items and magic

You can switch between "Items" and "Magic" with the right bumper and left bumper. Excepting for specific movement items (such as those which affect the spinner), you are still able to move after using items or magic. Some characters can even use items and/or magic multiple times over during a single turn!

{: .note }
> Magic hit rate  
> Select a magic spell and then a target. You can quickly snap the cursor between your character and Wallace (the bad guy) with the left bumper and right bumper. Move the cursor over your target and press the B button to get a sneak peek into the accuracy and expected damage of your attack. If multiple characters and/or monsters occupy the same space, they'll each be listed in turn.

{: .important }
> Speaking of turn...  
> When your turn finally comes around, that's when you're able to start issuing commands and manifesting your destiny. Your turn won't end until you've made your "Move", so feel free to issue any other commands with impunity. Characters who've died or are suffering from certain status ailments, however (see p.17), may have to pass their turns.

### Examine → Discover the world around you

Move the cursor over a space or character and press the B button to view detailed information about that space or character. You can speed up the cursor as you move it around by holding the X button.

### Data → See how things stack up

| Category | Content |
|:---------|:---------|
| Strength | Press the B button to cycle through stats, equipment, items, and magic. (Titles, too, which change based on one's actions in the game!) |
| Wealth | The gross value of all your assets. This is what determines your final ranking. |
| Treasure | A list of all your current treasures. |
| Alliance | Find out how many days remain before your alliance expires. |
| Battle Record | Find out how many times you've won, and how many times you've fallen. |
| All Villages | Check the earnings and treasure for all villages. |

### Target → What's next on the agenda?

You can double-check what goal the almighty Deus has bestowed upon you here.

### Settings → Tweak, adjust and save

| Category | Content |
|:---------|:---------|
| Config | Adjust text speed and visuals to your taste. |
| Music | Adjust the game volume or change the standard battle music. Note that when playing offline, all players share these settings. |
| Switch | Swap out a human player for computer AI, or computer AI for a human. |
| Controls | Swap out the controller used for play. |
| Advantage | Select whether or not each player receives an advantage during play. |
| Help | Turn helpful hints on or off. |
| Save | Save your current progress. |
| Title | Return to the title screen. |

{: .note }
> How to save  
> You can save via the Settings → Save command, or you can press the Y button as the new week dawns following any given (in-game) Sunday to save your game right then and there. This game has an autosave feature, too, so you never need to fear ending your play session for the time being.

## How to Fight Right!
{: .d-inline-block }

BATTLE SYSTEM
{: .label .label-red }

### 1. Set the Battle Coin: Will you be an attacker or defender this turn?

Whether a character makes the first move or defends against the enemy is determined by the Battle Coin. The Battle Coin can be flipped by pressing left or right on the D-pad, and revealed with the B button.

### 2. Check stats and enter commands

Damage will be reduced if the Defender presses the same button as the Attacker (e.g. Attack ⟺ Defense, Magic Attack ⟺ Magic Defense, etc.). Also, if the Defender chooses "Counter" in response to the Attacker's "Finishing Move," it will deal devastating counterattack damage! Special Skills, however, are a whole different ballgame, their effects varying quite significantly by character.

### 3. After battle...

Rewards are given or taken depending on whether you win or lose the battle. The winner can choose the reward.

- **Victory!**  
  Aside from the standard EXP and gold, you may become the owner of a village if you defeated a village monster, or you may receive a divine reward if you defeated a boss monster.

- **Surrender!**  
  Staves off defeat, but some of your money, items, and/or magic will be lost, and you'll lose your next turn.

- **Defeat!**  
  Some of your money, items, and/or villages will be lost, and you'll lose several turns. Big bummer!

- **Still in the game!**  
  If no one's victorious yet, battle will continue into the next turn.

{: .note }
> Defeating another  
> Force another character to surrender and you can take their money or items and/or inflict status ailments upon them (see p.17). You may change the name of a defeated opponent, for max humiliation!

## Watch Out for Status Ailments!
{: .d-inline-block }

STATUS EFFECTS
{: .label .label-red }

| Status | Recovery Time | Effect & Recovery Method |
|:-------|:-------------|:------------------------|
| **Paralysis** | 2-4 turns | Cannot move from the current space. Use a Panacea to recover instantly. |
| **Sleep** | 1-4 turns | Sleep through your next turn. Wake up after being stricken with a magic attack. |
| **Drunk** | 1 + 1-4 turns | A random command is triggered without player input on the next turn, then the character falls asleep. |
| **Fear** | 4-6 turns | Cannot attack other characters or boss monsters. Recover at a Monastery or Dokapon Castle (see p.20). |
| **Seal** | 3-5 turns | Items and magic cannot be used. Recover at a Monastery or Dokapon Castle. |
| **Footsore** | 3-5 turns | Can only move one space at a time. Recover at a Monastery or Dokapon Castle, or by using a Panacea. |
| **Wanted** | 4-6 turns | Unable to visit the castle, monasteries, shops, or freed villages due to the bounty on your head! Also unable to surrender in battle. |
| **Down** | 3-5 turns | Stats are reduced (shown in red). This is treated separately from stats reduced by magic. |
| **Poison** | Does not recover naturally | Take damage every turn. Recover at a Monastery or Dokapon Castle, or by using a Panacea. |
| **Curse** | Does not recover naturally | You'll sometimes attack yourself in battle. Use a Soul Mop to recover instantly. |
| **Possession** | Does not recover naturally | Sometimes unable to move in battle. Use a Soul Mop to recover instantly. |
| **Ebola** | Does not recover naturally | A deadly, mysterious virus. Use a Miracle Antidote to recover instantly. |

## Dokapon Castle and the Monastery!
{: .d-inline-block }

FACILITIES
{: .label .label-blue }

### Facility spaces

| Facility | Function |
|:---------|:---------|
| **Dokapon Castle** | The starting point of your adventure. You can cure status ailments for free here, or warp to other continents. |
| **Temple** | Make a donation to cure status ailments. You can also warp to other continents from here. |
| **Villages, towns, and cities** | Citizens will provide revenue to the landowner of their village, town, or city, and treasure can be found within as well. |
| **Item Shop** | Many useful items are for sale here. You can also appraise any treasures you've collected. |
| **Weapon Shop** | A great place to find the latest weapons to increase Attack and armor to increase Defense! |
| **Magic Shop** | Stock up on field magic for use in the overworld, as well as "Offensive Magic" and "Defensive Magic" for use in battle. |
| **Inn** | Spend the night (and 200G cold, hard cash) to completely restore your HP. Open on (in-game) Saturdays and Sundays, too! |
| **Bank** | Receive a lump-sum payment of your earnings from all the territories you own on the continent, and maybe put that money into a savings account to accrue some sweet, sweet interest! |
| **Casino** | Pay the entrance fee for a chance to win items and strike it rich. |
| **Colosseum** | This is where the fabled "Tenkaichi Tournament" takes place! Can only be entered during the event. |
| **Entrance** | Enter a dungeon (which takes the form of a whole new board/map!). Dungeons include caves, towers, and the like. |

### Passage spaces

| Space Type | Effect |
|:-----------|:-------|
| **Normal space** | Just a regular road for regular travel. Low-level monsters may spawn and events may take place here. |
| **Normal space (Snowfield)** | The spinner only goes up to 3 in this dense snow. Low-level monsters may spawn and events may take place here. |
| **Swamp** | Just passing through this space inflicts Poison status. Low-level monsters may spawn and events may take place here. |
| **Trap space (4 types)** | Take damage if you land on it. Low-level monsters may spawn and events may take place here. |
| **One-way space** | You can only move in the direction the arrow is pointing. Low-level monsters may spawn and events may take place here. |

### Item/magic spaces

| Space Type | Effect |
|:-----------|:-------|
| **Item space** | Congratulations! You get whatever item the cursor lands on. |
| **Magic space** | Congratulations! You get whatever magic the cursor lands on. |
| **? space** | Who knows what might happen here...? Could be treasure. Could be a trap! |
| **Treasure chest** | A locked treasure chest. Use a Magic Key to get a rare item! |
| **Safe** | Congratulations! You get whatever money the cursor indicates. |

### Castle & Monastery Features

#### 1. Recover from status ailments!

Either of these facilities can cure a number of status ailments. Treatment is free at the castle, but you must make a donation to the monastery if you seek their services.

{: .note }
> Selecting "All" when prompted what you wish the monastery to cure, though, may afford you recovery of multiple status ailments at once for a relatively low cost. Pro tip, that!

#### 2. Warp to other continents!

Beginning with Chapter 2, you can warp to other continents from Dokapon Castle or from any monastery. The warp will take you to a monastery at the destination, or to Dokapon Castle if warping to the Pionnier continent. Do take note, however, that warping costs money, and some destinations are more expensive than others.

#### 3. Return from the dead!

Dead characters are taken to Dokapon Castle or to a monastery and revived a few turns later. Your ranking at the time determines how many turns are required to bring you back.

Select "Repent" at a monastery to mark it as your revival point.

{: .warning }
> When you die, will you see an angel... or the Reaper?!  
> A messenger from above will come to meet you when you die. An angel will only take a small amount from you as penance, but if you're facing the Reaper, you stand to lose your entire inventory of items and magic!

{: .important }
> Battles between characters happen on road and village spaces.  
> Character battles will only trigger on road and village spaces.  
> Therefore, hiding out in shop or item spaces when you want to avoid battle is a perfectly valid strategy.  
> But be warned: you'll never level-up if you don't face your competition head-on!

## The More Villages, the Better!
{: .d-inline-block }

TERRITORY
{: .label .label-green }

### Accumulate villages, towns, and cities

#### 1. Defeat monsters
Defeat a village monster or the fiendish Wallace on a village, town, or city space and that village, town, or city will be freed and added to your territory. Should you defeat the village monster from afar with field magic, that village will become ownerless, and the next player to land on its space will claim it automatically.

#### 2. Steal from other characters
You can buy territory out from under other players' noses should the mayors of those villages, towns, or cities offer to sell their land, or you can just snatch that territory away by using a Charm Potion. Attacking a territory can score you its citizens' revenue and treasures, but will not result in usurping the territory itself.

### Develop villages into towns, and towns into cities!

When landing on a village or town you own, the mayor may ask you to contribute toward its development—should you have the money to do so. Doing so will result in increased citizen revenue, so it may just be a sound investment!

{: .warning }
> If a monster appears in a village, town, or city  
> Should a monster descend upon one of the player's territories, that monster will take control of the space. The next player to free that space will be entitled to all the citizens' revenue and treasure that's been amassed since your last audit, so it's always best to keep tabs on your land!

### Advantages of villages, towns, and cities

#### 1. Citizen revenue
Citizens help fund those who control their space, contributing to the "cause" each and every day. Stop on the space itself or swing by the bank to claim all due revenue from that territory. The exact amount varies based on location and development level (village, town, or city).

#### 2. Treasure
Citizens will uncover valuable treasure for you. The treasures they find are stored in the villages themselves for safekeeping, and the mayors of those villages will pass them along to you whenever you drop by.

#### 3. HP recovery
Visit a village, town, or city in your territory when your HP is low and the mayor may offer you accommodations. When that happens, your HP will be completely restored for free.

#### 4. Events
There are events that may only occur at villages, towns, and cities in your territory. Some could result in finding treasure, or otherwise lead to a massive payday!

{: .warning }
> Don't be stingy...  
> It would behoove you to pay up when a mayor seeks your contribution, as failure to do so could shut you out of your own territory—all of it!—for a little while. This can even happen if you simply don't have enough money, so try to remain reasonably solvent at all times!

{: .note }
> Check citizen revenue and treasure!  
> You can view information on all the villages, towns, and cities in play via the Data → All Villages command (see p.15). It's best to keep a sharp eye on territories under your control so you know when and where to claim citizen revenue and when is best to visit the bank on the current continent, but it's just as vital to keep an eye on enemy territories so you can plan the most lucrative possible raids!

## Shop Like a Pro!
{: .d-inline-block }

SHOPPING
{: .label .label-blue }

### Visiting shops

#### Weapon Shop

| Command | Function |
|:--------|:---------|
| **[Buy]** | You can purchase not just weapons here, but armor (including both body armor and shields) as well. This equipment will have a profound impact on your stats, so pick and choose the right gear for you and press the B button to finalize the purchase. Previous equipment will be traded in automatically. |
| **[Sell]** | Sell items, spells, or equipment (weapons and armor alike) from your inventory, as applicable. |
| **[Attack]** | Succeed, and you'll get your selection for free. (Fail, however, and you'll be wanted for your crimes!) |
| **[Quit]** | End your turn. |

{: .note }
> Note that along with Buy, the Sell, Attack, and Quit commands listed above apply not just to Weapon Shops, but Magic and Item Shops as well.

#### Item Shop

**[Buy]** Items have a wide range of effects. Select the right one for you and press the B button to finalize the purchase! Characters can carry between 8 and 12 items at one time.

**[Apprs.]** (Appraise) Determine the value and effect of a treasure. Each item appraised costs 100G.

#### Inn

**[Stay]** Fully restore your HP for 200G. Inns are open every day of the week, including Saturdays and Sundays.

#### Magic Shop

**[Buy]** Magic has a wide range of effects. Select the right one for you and press the B button to finalize the purchase!

###### Types of magic
- **Field Magic**: Magic that can be used on the overworld/board (rather than during battle). Characters can have between 8 and 12 varieties of magic at the ready at any given time.
- **Offensive Magic**: Press the Y button in battle when you're the Attacker to use Offensive Magic. Characters can carry up to 99 of any one variety of spell at a time.
- **Defensive Magic**: Press the Y button in battle when you're the Defender to use Defensive Magic. Each variety of Defensive Magic can be used repeatedly.

### Utilizing banks

#### 1. Receive a lump sum from all your territories on the continent
All the revenue you've amassed from territories under your control within the current continent goes right into your pocket. This is a much more efficient way to collect your earnings than by visiting each village, town, and city in turn. Plus, if you're feeling daring, you can use the "Steal" command at a bank to rob other characters of their earnings!

#### 2. Store big money for that sweet, sweet interest
The bank will pay you 3% interest each week on any money you have saved up. Your hard-earned fortune is much safer from other characters in the bank than in your pocket, too, since savings are untouchable by would-be thieves!

{: .note }
> Debit Card  
> Store enough money in the bank and you'll receive a "Debit Card" (a.k.a. a credit card!). With it, you can buy from Weapon, Item, and Magic Shops even if you don't have enough money on hand for the purchase. The downside is, your purchases will cost 30% more than usual! A new card can be issued at a bank should yours wind up lost or stolen.

### Casinos

Pay the entrance fee to try your hand at one of three card games: "High-Low," "Two Pair," or "Shuffle." You won't know which until you're at the table, however! You can quit any time you'd like, but the prizes and the pot do just keep getting grander and grander the longer you play...

{: .warning }
> Steel yourself when stealing!  
> If all goes well, you can get huge sums of money or rare items by using the "Attack" command at villages, towns, cities, shops, and banks. However, if your heist should fail, you'll become a wanted criminal (see p.17)! And wanted criminals can't restore HP at inns, nor can they visit villages, towns, or cities. But the thrill of being a fugitive is all part of the fun, right? Right?!

## Check Out These Events!
{: .d-inline-block }

ALLIANCES
{: .label .label-purple }

### Ally, ally, oxen free?

#### 1. Forging bonds at event time
All players will take part in an alliance event at a certain point. When this happens, you'll be prompted to choose whom (if anyone) you'd like to align with. The almighty Deus will then hear your plea and grant the alliance should the other party be of like mind.

#### 2. Assistive allies
Allies will offer you support in battle (behavioral modifications from status ailments notwithstanding), employing the same battle commands you do (except in the case of "Special Skills"). When "Magic" is chosen, both you and your ally will fire off your spells in tandem, seamlessly combining your forces.

#### 3. Sharing EXP and treasure
Both characters receive experience points (EXP) in the case of jointly fought battles. As for treasure, the almighty Deus will split any collected treasure amongst you two once the alliance has come to an end.

{: .important }
> Alliances make all the difference in battle!  
> Since allied support characters use the same commands in battle as you do, every attack becomes twice as potent. What's more, combined Offensive Magic strikes make for ultra-powerful tandem attacks! For example, if you cast "Meteor" in battle, your ally will do the same, and the result will be the far more powerful "Mega Meteor" spell!

### Darkling form
{: .d-inline-block }

SPECIAL EVENTS
{: .label .label-red }

#### 1. Turn the tables by becoming the debbles!
Not only are all your stats tripled when you become a Darkling, your "Move" spinner also multiplies, giving you 2 to 5 spinners in total to achieve "Super Spinner" status! However, the power of darkness doesn't come cheap, as your entire inventory (including territories under your control) will be forfeit—with the exceptions of equipment and treasure, thankfully! The ability to visit shops and even acquire items will be out of reach for you as well.

#### 2. Summon monsters to villages!
Monsters will descend upon any village, town, or city the Darkling visits. If a village monster happens to already be there, the Darkling will recover HP.

#### 3. Trigger eeeevil events!
The "Event" command (see p.14) will be made available to you as a Darkling, allowing you to throw a monkey wrench in other players' plans or summon a ton of village monsters all at once. Build up your Dark Aura to trigger even more impactful events! Dark Aura is amassed a little each day, but is consumed as events are triggered.

#### 4. Regain your humanity at the temple
You can revert to human form at any time by visiting a temple; you don't need to wait for the transformation to wear off!

> Two kinds of Darkling events  
> If you transform into a Darkling by meeting specific conditions while ranked last place, you can stay in that form for a max number of in-game days proportional to the in-game weeks that have passed thus far (for example, 12 days if the game is in its 12th week). If you transform through other means, you can remain in Darkling form for up to 10 days only, but you at least won't lose any of your savings in the process!

### Even more events!
{: .d-inline-block }

SPECIAL EVENTS
{: .label .label-purple }

It's not all alliances and Darklings; a wide variety of events, both large and small, await you in your quest! Take the "Tenkaichi Tournament," for example, where all the characters battle it out until only one remains standing. Or the "Sports Day" shopping race, where the challenge is to see who can buy a certain item and be the first to bring it back to Dokapon Castle. Events like these are plentiful, and any one of them can turn the rankings upside-down in the blink of an eye!

GAME SETTINGS
{: .label .label-purple }

You can customize settings to your liking before you even begin, in fun ways that were simply not possible in this game's original release. This includes things like setting a week limit to keep the game length under control, or beginning the match by giving every player one of every treasure uncovered thus far.

### Game Settings

| Setting | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Week Limit** | Forcibly end the game after a set number of (in-game) weeks. You can enter any number of weeks here, from 1 to 999. |
| **Treasure For All** | Activate this feature, and all players will start the game with one of every treasure uncovered thus far in their inventory. |
| **Map Event Rate** | Adjust the frequency of events occurring on road spaces. |
| **Weekly Event Rate** | Adjust the frequency of events occurring at the start of a new (in-game) week. |
| **Wallace Interference Rate** | Adjust the frequency of Wallace's intrusions. |
| **Reaper Appearance Rate** | Adjust the odds of the Reaper appearing after death. |
| **Required Wallace Takedowns** | Adjust how many times Wallace must be defeated for the story to advance. |
| **Standard Alliance Duration** | Adjust how long alliances forged during events will last before naturally coming to an end. Select "None" and no alliance events will trigger during play. |
| **Meet at Tenkaichi Tournament** | Choose whether players will continue from the Tenkaichi Tournament arena or return to their previous positions after the tournament has concluded. (Selecting "No" returns players to their previous positions.) |
| **Offensive Magic Limit** | Choose whether or not there's an upper limit to the number of magic attacks players can stock. |
| **Level Up Bonus** | Adjust how many points are awarded for allocation upon leveling up. |

## Online Mode
{: .d-inline-block }

MULTIPLAYER
{: .label .label-green }

Online Mode allows players to face off no matter where in the world they may be. Either join someone else's group, or create a group of your own, and get to money-grubbing!

### Create Group


1. **Players**  
   Select the number of players, controllers, etc.  
   C = CPU (computer AI player)  
   G = Guest (Players using the group creator's account)

2. **Name**  
   Select a name for the player who'll be joining this game.  
   (This option is unavailable for offline players!)

3. **Recruit (+ passwords, etc.)**  
   Select recruiting method:
   - Friends-Only: Only registered friends can join the game.
   - Password-Protected: Set a password for the game. Only players who know this password are permitted to join.
   - Recruit (Open): Anyone can join the game!

4. **Recruiting on standby**  
   Remain on standby until the desired number of players have been found. Settings can still be adjusted while on standby. Additionally, if the group's creator so determines, the game can be started at any time from standby, even if the desired number of recruits has yet to be met.

{: .note }
> Advantage settings  
> The group's creator can choose whether or not each of the participating players is eligible to receive advantages. If granted, each player can choose whether or not to apply these advantages.

### Join Group


1. **Recruit (Find a group)**  
   Choose a group to join from the list displayed.  
   There are three types of groups: Friends-Only and Password-Protected restrict who can join, while Open allows anyone at all to join.  
   *Note that any groups with games already in progress will NOT be displayed on this list, regardless of settings!

2. **Recruit (Standby)**  
   Even after successfully joining a group, the game will not begin until the group is full or the group's creator elects to manually start the game.  
   All "Secret Ingredient" settings can be reviewed and confirmed while on standby.  
   You may also press the join button at any time to remind others of your intention to join the game (though doing so is NOT required).

### Continue

Only autosave is available during Online Mode for recording game progress.  
Unfinished games can be picked up from right where they were left off once all players are present.
