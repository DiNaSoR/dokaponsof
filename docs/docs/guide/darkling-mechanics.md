## Overview

The Darkling system in DOKAPON! Sword of Fury offers a unique comeback mechanic and alternative playstyle. Unlike previous games, Darklings in Sword of Fury can potentially win the game while remaining in Darkling form.

## Darkling Duration

{: .important }
> Number of Darkling turns = Number of weeks at time of transformation
> 
> Example: Transforming on Week 25 grants 25 turns of Darklingdom

## Basic Mechanics

### Movement & Healing
- Can heal HP and status effects when landing on monster-occupied locations
- Can summon monsters on locations without existing monsters
- Can visit a Temple at any time to revert back to normal

### Actions & Limitations
Darklings can:
- Steal up to three items
- Steal up to three Field Magic
- Steal all money
- Discard all items and Field Magic
- Steal 1 random treasure
- Change player names

Darklings cannot:
- Steal or discard villages
- Use the Forgive command (unavailable in this version)

## Darkling Points System

{: .note }
Unlike previous games, Darkling points in Sword of Fury are not random. Points accumulate at a fixed rate per turn.

Default Rate (Tiny setting):
- 4 Darkling points per turn
- Rate can be increased via secret options

### Darkling Powers

| Points | Power | Effect |
|:-------|:------|:-------|
| 10 | Land Warp | Warp to any continent via Temple/Castle |
| 20 | Debilitate | Inflict random status effects on all other players |
| 30 | Rough Up | Deal massive damage to all players |
| 40 | Keep Moving | Block players from using spaces that prevent Darkling access |
| 50 | Worker Strike | Close all stores temporarily |
| 60 | Regression | Downgrade all locations on current continent |
| 70 | Army Attack | Summon monsters to all locations on current continent |
| 80 | Come Here | Warp all other players to Darkling's space |
| 90 | Market Crash | Steal large amounts from other players' bank savings |
| 100 | Great Army Attack | Global version of Army Attack |

## Strategy Tips

### As a Darkling
{: .text-delta }

- Market Crash (90 points) is potentially the most powerful ability
- Can maintain Darkling form indefinitely in long games
- Consider timing transformation based on week number for maximum turns

### Against a Darkling
{: .text-delta }

- Keep a balanced split between on-hand cash and bank savings
- Forces Darkling to choose between Come Here or Market Crash
- Plan temple visits strategically

{: .warning }
In extended games (170+ weeks), Darklings can accumulate enough points to use both Come Here and Market Crash, making them extremely dangerous.
